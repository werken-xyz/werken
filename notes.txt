Motivation
==========

To me (Florian Schulze) it feels like information about most crafting areas is very distributed and often behind paywalls.
I imagine something where one can go to look for information and initially mostly terminology about several crafts to have a better jumping of point.
For most crafting a basic knowledge of safety procedures is pretty essential to prevent injury.
There are also regional differences in procedures, terminology, supplies and tools which make it harder to use the existing knowledge (mainly from YouTube).
In germany there is a lack of trainees for most crafts, which IMO is partly caused by an information deficit and that most children don't see craftsman doing their work in their daily lives.
